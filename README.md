# AMIL

This ia re-implementation of https://github.com/utayao/Atten_Deep_MIL which in turn is a re-implementation of ICML 2018 paper "Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04712.pdf).
It has the following enhancements
1. Extraction of attntion weights
2. Visualization of weights across feature maps in a layer
3. Visualization of weights across layers.
